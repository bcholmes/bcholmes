## Hi

I'm BC Holmes. I'm a software developer interested in a variety of technologies, development tools and topics. Some of my particular interests include:

1. Privacy technologies
2. Code analysis and code generation
3. Data visualization
4. Open source
5. 3D technology.

At the moment, a lot of my time is spent adding to and improving the [Star Trek Adventures character creator](https://github.com/bcholmes/StarTrek2d20), a 
tool for creating characters (and other things) for the Star Trek Adventures roll-playing game.
